# Smart-Traffic-Control-System

Created By: Patrik Beqo and Sarvath Sharma

# Purpose:
We are on the verge of creating a Smart Traffic Control System. By using Image Processing Tools from Matlab we aim to take an input, which will be a video of an intersection where we will interpret the density of the traffic flow throughout certain points in time. This data will then be used to determine the duration of traffic signals and will show a histogram of the traffic flow. The histogram will show the number of cars and from which direction the density is the largest (TBD). 

# Process:
1. Grab videos of traffic intersections
2. Analyze the density and patterns of the environment using Matlab
3. Write said data into a file and store it for reference
4. Using Python (TBD) analyze the video and output final parameters
5. Output will be in a GUI or just another data file (TBD)


# Video Format
We will be using .mp4 file formats.
